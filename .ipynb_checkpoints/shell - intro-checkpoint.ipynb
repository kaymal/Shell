    "Since human beings aren't digital, they need an interface to interact with the operating system. The most common one these days is a graphical file explorer, which translates clicks and double-clicks into commands to open files and run programs. Before computers had graphical displays, though, people typed instructions into a program called a **command-line shell**. Each time a command is entered, the shell runs some other programs, prints their output in human-readable form, and then displays a prompt to signal that it's ready to accept the next command. (Its name comes from the notion that it's the \"outer shell\" of the computer.)\n",

If you are in /home/repl/seasonal, then `cd ..` moves you up to /home/repl. If you use `cd ..` once again, it puts you in /home. One more `cd ..` puts you in the root directory `/`, which is the very top of the filesystem.
